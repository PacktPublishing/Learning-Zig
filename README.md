Solve complex problems in C++ by learning how to think like a computer scientist. This book introduces computational thinking—a framework for solving problems using decomposition, abstraction, and pattern recognition—and shows you how to apply it using modern C++ features. You'll learn how to break down challenges, choose the right abstractions, and build solutions that are both maintainable and efficient. 
Through small examples and a large case study, this book guides you from foundational concepts to high-performance applications. You’ll explore reusable templates, algorithms, modularity, and even parallel computing and GPU acceleration. With each chapter, you’ll not only expand your C++ skillset, but also refine the way you approach and solve real-world problems. 
Written by a seasoned research engineer and C++ developer, this book combines practical insight with academic rigor. Whether you're designing algorithms or profiling production code, this book helps you deliver elegant, effective solutions with confidence. </details>

_Sam Morley_ Sam Morley is a research software engineer and mathematician at the University of Oxford, working on the DataSig programme. He's the lead maintainer of the RoughPy library, a performant C++ and Python library for computation rough paths and data science. Sam is a former mathematics lecturer and brings both academic precision and real-world engineering experience to every challenge—especially those involving abstraction, data, and algorithms. He's also the author of Applying Math with Python. Sam greatly enjoys solving puzzles, which is why he finds mathematics and programming so interesting
